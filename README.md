#WAGGLE
**_waggleon.surge.sh_**

##Elevator Pitch
A location-based, social-media app that allows you to search for dog-friendly places, find cute dogs, and meet other local dog-lovers!

## MVP
1. Functional login/signup for (new) users
2. Getting user's current location
3. List of nearby locations - yelp search results (map is secondary)
4. Click to view an individual location
  - url ex: `/search/?category=restaurant`
  - User can check-in (mark themselves as there)
  - Show users who checked-in at location within the last hour
5. User can checkin to place

## Server-Side Collections
- Users
- Matches
  - Join matches between users and matches
- Checkins
  - join between users and locations
  - Include user id, location id, time it was made
- PlacesCollection

##Data Modeling
  - Connecting session-user with other user IF MATCHED
  - Connecting checkins with individual places

##Building Tools & Libraries
1. React
5. Babel Preset React
6. Backbone
7. Underscore
8. Moment
9. Normalize-SCSS
10. jQuery  

##Basic Features
1. Search (places/users(and dogs))
  - Search dog-friendly or dog-related places that you can visit/people have checked in to
  - Users can filter search to meet specific requirements
    - Filtered results could be "off-leash", "park", "outdoors", "bar", etc.
  - Based of user's current location (returns results within specific range of user's location)
2. Map & Search Results
  - Show nearby dog-related places
    - Users can search for nearby parks/dog hangout spots
    - Users can add/edit submitted locations
  - Waggle maps will show you locations near you that have been 'liked' by waggle users
    - This is the place's percentage approval rating, based on Waggle users
  - Shows where users are with their dogs (if checked in)
  - Search results give detailed view/description of the place
    - Also show's who was checked in there and since when
    - Only shows who was there for that day (sorted from most recent checkins)
3. Matching/Friending
  - Only matched users are allowed to message each other
  - User can delete entire message history, but not edit messages in any other way
    - This will not affect recipient user's message history
4. User Profile
  - Only up to 6 photos allowed for the user to upload
    - Use file uploads
  - Users can edit their profile to be a short bio about themselves or their dog
    - User will specify (if they so choose) why they are on the app (meet new people, romantic interests, new in town and his/her dog needs new friends too!)

##StyleGuide
  1. Code indentation (white-space)
    - Use the tab, spaced at two-spaces
    - Only use tab-spacing (at 2-space size)
    - Math operators separated by a single-space around operators
    - Must use a single-space after `,`s
    - functions must not have space after declaration/before `()`s
      ex:
      ```js
      function myFunction() {},
      ```
  2. Naming
    - All names start with a lower-case letter
    - JavaScript names must be camel-cased and start with a lower-case letter
    - HTML elements (including React elements) must be separated with `-` if more than one word long
    - components need to have `-component` in their name
      ```html
      <div classNme="app-component"></div>
      ```
    - Models & Collections:
      - Begin with UpperCase letter
      - Use CamelCasing
      - Files and constructors end in `Model`
        - ex: `SessionModel()`
    3. Syntax
      - Always end a simple-statement with a `;`
      - Use trailing commas in object-properties{} and arrays[]
        - ex:
        ```js

        export default React.createClass({
          getInitialState: function() {
            return {
              modal: null,
              places: store.placesCollection.toJSON(), //<-- here

            }
          }, // <-- here
        });        
        ```
        - Put closing bracket of functions and objects on new line
    4. Quotations
      - HTML elements (including React elements)
        - use `""`s
      - JavaScript
        - use `''`s
